File ward-usgs1994-suds.pdf is titled USGS Open-File Report 94-003 and dated
1994-05-11 but no corresponding report is in the USGS archive (1). This file
appears to contain the last description of the SUDS file format and was used
(along with comment lines in the relevant SAC source code) to create our SUDS
reader.

File ward-usgs_ofr_1989-188-SUDS.pdf was published 1989-03-29 and appears to
describe an older (mutually incompatible?) version of the file format.

File suds_structs.ods was created 2019-08-22 to track the tenuous correspondence
between SUDS documentation and reality.

The provenance of PC-SUDS.pdf is unknown.

The official status of ward-usgs1994-suds.pdf is unknown. The PDF contains many
inconsistencies with SAC "readsuds.c", ranging from header descriptions to
structure sizes in Bytes.

While I'm confident that trace data read correctly from test files, I am not
at all confident that SUDS headers read correctly in general. Trace data are
consistent with what SAC produces via. readsuds and write. Exotic and poorly-
tested header structures are not to be trusted.
