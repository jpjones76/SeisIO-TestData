win - seismic waveform gage support program
format
win [options] [waveform file]
1. win and is
win is a program that the gage support of seismic waveform data on a UNIX workstation X-Window. Display of the waveform on the screen, reading the manual, automatic, hypocenter determination, pushing and pulling plot, map display, you can, such as paste-up display.

This manual is written based on the 98.7.2 version of the win.
2. Prepare
 
2.1 program compilation
To take advantage of the win is a need to perform file win, you must also perform file hypomh of hypocenter determination program if the hypocenter determination. Both of these sources is a single file, win.c and hypomh.f. win.c is compiled as follows.


    cc win.c -lm -lX11 -o win

In SUN-OS 4 and Solaris 2


    cc win.c -I / usr / openwin / include -lm -L / usr / openwin / lib -lX11 -o win

In FreeBSD 2


    cc win.c -I / usr / X11R6 / include -lm -L / usr / X11R6 / lib -lX11 -o win

You may need to do the. Currently win is compatible with SUN-OS 4, NEWS-OS 4, Solaris 2, FreeBSD 2. In the case of SYSTEM V-based UNIX, "- DSYSTEMV" You may go well and put. Compilation of hypomh.f is as follows.


    f77 hypomh.f -o hypomh

 
2.2 Setting of the parameter file
win, read the various parameters from a text file win.prm of current directory. This parameter file can also be specified by giving any of the path name at the time of start-up win. 1 item of the set to one line in win.prm been, since when separated by spaces or tabs in the line will be ignored. There are currently 16 items of the setting matters, an example of a typical win.prm is something like the following.

    / Dat / trg / * data directory * / [1]
    /dat/etc/channels.tbl / * channel table * / [2]
    /dat/etc/zones.tbl / * zone file * / [3]
    / Dat / picks / man / / * picks directory * / [4]
    / Dat / bin / SPARC / hypomh / * hypomh program * / [5]
    /dat/etc/struct.tbl / * structure model * / [6]
    /dat/etc/map.japan.km / * map file * / [7]
    . / * Output directory * / [8]
    C / * output format * / [9]
    /dat/etc/filter.prm / * filter file * / [10]
    lp / * printer name * / [11]
    upper / * projection * / [12]
    /dat/etc/labels.tbl / * labels file * / [13]
    /dat/etc/final.man / * hypocenters file * / [14]
    100.0 / * printer's DPI * / [15]
    / Tmp / * working directory * / [16]

Content and its method of setting each item is as follows.

[One] directory the waveform data files
    First this directory waveform file given by the argument at the time of start-up, looks in the order of the current directory.
[2] channel table file
    It is to define the correspondence between the channel number and the observation point parameters of the waveform file is the "channel table file". If in the same directory as the waveform file, if there is a channel table file name that you made to the waveform file name ".ch" (or ".CH") it will be used. If not, the file you specify here will be used as a channel table file. However, if you want to keep with the "*" in the back of the specified file name here, a file with the name of "waveform file name .ch" is not used, if any. It should be noted that, even when you start to win in the map mode (option -m), because the waveform file is not specified, here observation point parameters from the specified channel table file in will be read. Channel table file is a text file information of one channel was written on one line, a line beginning with "#" are ignored. The first line has contains 18 pieces of items that are separated by one or more spaces. It shows an example of a single line.

        # [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
        0003 1 20 FUJ U 3 10 234 m / s 1.0 0.7

            [12] [13]. [14], [15] [16]. [17] [18]
            54 9.77e-3 35.3103 138.6789 1040 0.0 0.0

        The meaning of each item here is as follows.


            [1] 2 bytes of channel number (hexadecimal)
            [2] From the flag
            [3] line delay time (ms)
            [4] observation point code of up to 10 characters
            [5] component code of up to six characters
            [6] index that shows the amplitude reduction ratio of the monitor waveform (power number of 2)
            [7] A / D number of quantization bits of the conversion
            [8] sensor sensitivity (V / input amplitude units, input amplitude unit is shown in [9]), may be a real
            [9] input amplitude units in [8], in the MKS system, displacement is "m", speed is "m / s", acceleration be written as "m / s / s"
            [10] the natural period of the seismograph (s)
            [11] damping constant of seismograph
            [12] the voltage amplification factor from the sensor output to the A / D converter (dB)
            [13] A / D conversion of 1 quantization step width (V)
            [14] of the observation point latitude (°), to be positive north latitude
            [15] of the observation point longitude (°), to be positive east longitude
            [16] of the observation point above sea level altitude (m)
            [17] P-wave of the observation point correction (s), the epicenter computed by adding this to the observed value
            [18] S wave of observation point correction (s), ibid.

        Of these, [2], [3, 7], [10], [11], but does not use the win, it must not be blank. (14) because - [18] is a observation point specific value, if there is more than one channel to the monitoring point is, of which I, if written in the place of any one channel.

[3] Pathname of file containing the regional division of the observation point
    This file is in black-and-white inverts the observation point name in the boundary of the region together with determine the order of the sequence of the observation point of the monitor waveform, it will be used to display clearly. Write a regional name that begins with "#" at the beginning of each line, separated by a space or tab after them and arrange to write the observation point name that is contained therein. It shows an example of the two lines (two regions).

    # W-KANTO OKY FUJ FJZ KMR MTS FJO AKY SRY OYM
    # IZU-PEN HKN ATA NRY HAT USM

    It should be noted, this file might have been shared in other programs of the online recording system.
[4] path name of the directory of the gage information file
    win treats gage information of 1 earthquake as one file, but you set the directory that houses the gage information file here. However, years if this is where it ends with a "/", further assumption "years" under the directory (for example, "9408") and there is a monthly directory, such as the name, the appropriate of them of the directory will be used (when the win is started in the map display mode, the latest directory of "years" will be selected).
    ":" If you specify a second directory, separated by, at the same time as the first directory, gage information file is saved or updated in this directory. Gage information file name, from the year-milliseconds of "the earliest P time of the readings", will be created in the form of "YYMMHH.ddhhmm.sss". If there is no readings available, waveform file starting time is used, part of the case, "sss" is set to "000".

[5] path name of the hypocenter determination program
    win Specifies the path name of the hypocenter determination program hypomh to call.
[6] path name of the velocity structure file to be used for hypocenter determination
    hypomh is the velocity structure file to be used. The contents are as follows. Since FORTRAN of the formatted input digit position is important.


            [1 line] initial epicenter of latitude (°), longitude (°), depth (km) (3F10.0)
            The number and structure name in the second row] layer (I5,2X, A3)
            The top of the P-wave velocity in the third row] layers (km / s) (7F10.0)
            [Line 4] the thickness of each layer (km) (7F10.0)
            [Line 5] initial epicenter of the uncertainty (at the time of seismic source (s), latitude (km), longitude (km), depth (km)) (4F10.0) but of the "initial hypocenter uncertainty" "origin time (s)" is not actually used.

    Each layer has a constant positive velocity gradient, speed at the boundary of the layers will be continuous. S-wave velocity structure is, you will be asked from the P-wave velocity structure as Vp / Vs = 1.73. The top surface of the top layer in the altitude above sea level 0, there are a number of layers given from there in the second row, more usually below it placed a thick layer, until the speed of the bottom of this layer is given (for part of the above than the altitude above sea level 0, the top layer is calculated is deemed to have continued at the same speed gradient). Therefore, the number is "the number of layers," the second line of the +2 next to the "top of the P-wave velocity of each of the layers," given by the third line, the number of given "the thickness of each layer" in the fourth row, "the number of layers," the second line of the will be +1. It should be noted that the third and fourth lines, it may be two or more lines each in practice by the number of layers. Initial epicenter of latitude and longitude, in the win, because it is made by rounding appropriately the latitude and longitude of the most travel-time early observation point, is not actually used the values ​​given in the first row.
    The following is an example of the structure file.


        35.5 139.5 30.0
            6 ABC
        5.50 5.51 6.10 6.11 6.70 6.71 8.00
        8.20
        4.00 0.01 10.60 0.01 16.90 0.01 600.0
        5.0 100.0 100.0 30.0

[7] path name of the map data file that you want to use to display map
    In the map screen of the win, along with the epicenter and the observation point, [1] coastline, [2] the prefectural border, [3] The main trench axis, it is displayed. [1] to [3] are read from the file XY coordinates of the km unit from the origin was the binary format, but you specify the file here. Map as the distance from the origin will be distorted. It should be noted that this binary format file, you can make by converting from the text file in the "-c" option of win (rh "-c" option).
[8] path name of the directory where you want to output the waveform data files cut out
    And cut out the waveform of the enlarged display portion in the zoom waveform to a file, you can use, such as in other programs. To specify a directory of making that file here.
[9] cut format of waveform data
    Specify here the format of the file that is Dasa cut in the directory specified in [8]. The following are four types can be specified.

        Text by C 1 row and the first sample of the numbers
        B4 binary 4-byte integer
        B2 binary 2-byte integer *
        A audio format


                * Only the lower 2 bytes of the four bytes in the internal representation is taken, you must be careful because the numerical value in this case is clipping process does not even overflow.

[10] path name of the filter configuration file
    In the zoom waveform and paste-up screen of the waveform screen, you can apply a filter to the waveform. Filter is to be able to keep up to 30 different settings, to specify the file that describes the characteristics here. In this file, one of the filters in a row, set by the five or six of the items separated by a space. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored. Here is an example

            bpf fl = 5.0 fh = 20.0 fs = 30.0 ap = 0.5 as = 5.0
            hpf fp = 1.0 fs = 0.5 ap = 0.5 as = 5.0
            lpf fp = 0.5 fs = 0.8 ap = 0.5 as = 5.0
            bpf fl = 8.0 fh = 16.0 fs = 24.0 ap = 0.5 as = 5.0

    Filter is a low pass, high pass, three types of band pass Butterworth characteristics. The coefficient of determination and filtering,

            Masanori Saito, 1978, recurrence formula digital filter automatic design of the physical exploration, 31, 112-135

    We are using the program. For the choice of configuration parameters, please refer to the above documents.
    As a special use, with a line in the filter configuration file, when the "/" file name including the (path name) is given, win will load and use the coefficient sequence of filters from this file. The coefficient sequence file in a text format that one of the coefficients have been written on a single line, the coefficients can be written up to 400. win as filtering, it can make convolution of this coefficient columns and data.
[11] hard copy for the printer name
    In the win, you can take a screen hard copy of the printer. It is the printer name to set here (/ etc / entry name of the printcap) and is one of the control characters that specifies the system if necessary. First of all, when you gave the "&" in the back of the printer name, taken the window of the dump in xwd is converted to PS format xpr, it is output in lpr. Next, when you gave the "*" in the back of the printer name, dump of a window that was taken in xwd is output at the lpr -x. The SONY NEWS workstation This is the default. It should be noted that, without writing the printer name "&" or "*" is not output If you specify only the character of the printer, in the current directory, instead, by each of the format, that each win.ps or win.xwd file name will be created. In summary these are as follows.

        The control character commands * format output file name
        & Xwd | xpr -device ps | lpr PostScript win.ps
        * Xwd | lpr -x XWD win.xwd


                * "Commands" is not this street is exactly a schematic.

    In addition ":" If you specify a second printer name, separated by, when you save the gage information, will also output to this printer is its contents at the same time. This is a feature that is used to mainly transmit the results of the automatic gage. Usually, printer filter which receives the output is appropriate to convert the format, reports the gage results to the data center by e-mail and the like.
[12] initial push and pull the plot at the time of the projection hemisphere
    Specify the "upper" or "lower". This is used to specify the initial state, you can switch among the win.
[13] path name of the configuration file of the labels attached to gage information file
    The first line of the gage information file, consisting of the text of the normal number of characters, you can include a label for the classification. As the label, from among those ordered to write in a file that you specify here, it will be given to selected in the win. One label in one line in this file, for example,

            NOISE
            BLAST
            LOCAL

    Set as. Lines starting with "#" are ignored. The number of labels at a maximum of 30, but the number of characters in one of the label can be up to 18 characters, depending on the program you may fifth character or the sixth character since the time of the display is omitted.
[14] path name of the directory to find the epicenter data file for display map
    When the display of the map from the hypocenter database, here is read the epicenter data files in the specified directory one after another, it will be displayed epicenter. If one file name rather than a directory is specified, the epicenter data from this file only is read. If the specified directory or file could not be opened, but will be loaded all the hypocenter information of gage information files contained in the directory specified in [4], because this is very time consuming, except when the number of seismic source is small, not recommended. The format of the hypocenter database file in either the text or binary format, win loads to automatically determine. In the case of the text in the first row and the first earthquake,

        92 11 19 16 4 4.373 35.18776 140.20154 30.105 2.6 auto BLAST

    Those that the epicenter element and the gage's name and label arranged to write, separated by spaces as, the general of the hypocenter data is the most simple way to use in the win. It should be noted that the gage's name and the label is not mandatory.
    Such a database file from a plurality of gage information files that are placed in one directory, use the command pick2final,

        (Cd [pick dir]; ls -l | pick2final)> [text hypo file]

    You can make as. Binary format, which is what began to write the internal representation of the structure HypoB that are defined in the win.c in the file, which is also used in the same manner as in command pick2finalb

        (Cd [pick dir]; ls -l | pick2finalb)> [binary hypo file]

    You can make as. Conversion between text binary format both each other, you can use the filter program final2finalb and finalb2final.
Constant for adjusting the [15] of the hardcopy size
    Map display of the scale, the number corresponding to "N" of "1 / N ten thousand" have been displayed on the screen. This is not necessarily correctly on the display, to so that this number when you took the hard copy (with the left button) representing the correct scale is the role of the numerical value to be set here. In other words, the linear density of the dots on the display, or become what DPI on the hard copy, you should be set here. Once, when it is set to "100", but should look like a hard copy can be taken to scale to the printer of 400DPI, it is recommended that you try to check once actually in any event .
[16] path name of the directory to create a temporary file for work
    win will make some of the temporary work files while running, it will be erased at the end. Specify the directory for this here. Temporary to file include the following: (pid is the process number).

        File name role
        Waveform data file when you start in win.dat.pid "-t" option
        Record of win.log.pid operating conditions and automatic processing elapsed (mainly for debugging)
        To store the epicenter data in win.others.pid map screen mode
        At the input to the win.seis.pid hypomh, observation point coordinate and readings
        At the input to the win.init.pid hypomh, initial value information
        The output from the win.report.pid hypomh, report of the calculation process, etc.
        The output from the win.final.pid hypomh, calculation results

    And when you view the seismic source database, "- t" When you start in the option, you may need an empty capacity of more than a few MB.

 
2.3 win of the execution environment

win of the waveform gage mode, the list of messages and gage-hypocenter information in the run, when to be output to the terminal window from which you started the win, to control the overlapping manner of the terminal window and other windows. The "window number" in the terminal window required for that, win gets as environment variable WINDOWID. Therefore, in order to run the win is, the terminal window that you want to start, and requires that the environment variable WINDOWID has been set. However, when it is activated in non-waveform gage mode (such as the map display mode), this is you do not need. There is no problem because it is in xterm and kterm originally set, but like OpenWindows command tool, the user must keep setting this. this is,

    xwininfo -int

In to examine the value of the window number,

    setenv WINDOWID window number

To to you perform like. In addition, as has already been mentioned, a properly configured parameter file (usually win.prm of the current directory) is required.

Caution when X server and client is another machine: When you run the win on the remote machine, such as telnet, you need to be aware that the following three conditions are met.

(1)
    That the environment variable WINDOWID has been set. This is as described above. Of course xwininfo will run on the local machine.
(2)
    That the environment variable DISPLAY is set correctly. This is, for example, "myhost: 0.0" is a format such as.
(3)
    The X server on the local machine, that the remote machines has allowed to open a window. This can be if you use the xhost command on the local machine.

 
3 execution
 
3.1 start-up of the win and end

How to start the win is,

    win [- options] [waveform data file name]

is. [] Represents that it is not essential. Some options take arguments. The waveform file name, often the form of representing the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second "YYMMDD.hhmmss" (for example 940,802.055459) is used, in this case, looks like it is possible to omit certain degree . First of all, part of the "ss" can be omitted, if there are multiple is if the appropriate file, (lower values) the earliest ones are taken. Then, if it is in the current month "YYMM" it can also be omitted. In addition, "YYMMDD." When the just ".", Is replaced by the date of the day, the day before when the same manner as in "..", "..." two days before that it is, to Fu called, "YYMMDD" it can be abbreviated part. If for example, today is the August 3, example of the file,

    win ..0554

In can be specified. However, when you specify the waveform file in the path name (including clogging "/") it is, can be omitted only "ss". It should be noted that, in the above description, the "." Part that is the will work with "_" (underscore). This is in order to comply with the waveform data file name to ISO9660 of the CD-ROM format.

Startup options are as follows.

    [16]

These are described below.

[1]
    (-a) You can make automatic gage after startup. "-n" The results unless you set the option is stored in the file. Below it is intended to be used in measuring online automatic biopsy.

        win -abwt -p win.prm.auto waveform data file name

[2]
    (-b) Without generating a window, waveform and maps are not displayed. Therefore, it does not require any X server. It will also be set automatically "-q" option. It will be used in conjunction with the normal "-a" Ya "-w" options. Please note that this is different than a shell background mode.
[3]
    (-c) Of text format map data file, and converts it to a binary format. Input is standard input, output in standard output, latitude (°) of origin as an argument and longitude (°) is required. It should be noted that the sign will be a north latitude and east longitude and positive.

        win -c 35 140 <text map file> binary map file

    Use as. At this time win is done only the operation of the map data conversion, can not be specified at the same time as other options, also waveform data files can not be specified. Map data in a text format as an input, the coastline, the prefectural border, the main representative of the coordinate values ​​of each of the vector data of the trench axis latitude as (°) longitude (°), 1 pair on a single line, separated by spaces thing was arranged to write by. First to the coastline, then the prefectural border, the last to have entered in the order of the trench axis, in particular,

        999.99 0.0

    Instructs is discontinuous, that is, the movement in the PEN-UP,

        9999.99 0.0

    Indicates the beginning of discontinuity and prefectural border,

        99999.99 0.0

    Indicates the beginning of discontinuity and trench axis,

        999.99 999.99

    It indicates the end of data.
[4]
    The top and bottom and left edge of the window (-f) win is to generate, to match that of the screen. This, together with the use of the height of the screen to the fullest, to at least these directions, gone is that the cursor is protrude to the outside of the window of the win, it might be easy to operate. However, can not be used anymore got hidden title bar, not attached outer frame when he took a hard copy. In rare cases, but there is a case that instead of visible title bar hidden the lower end of the portion of the window, this time if able to re launch will go mostly well.
[Five]
    (-h) Displays a list of how to start and optional win (help).
[6]
    (-m) To enter the start-up after the map screen, read the hypocenter database file, for the region centered on the origin of the map file, the first displays the epicenter of the past one day (rh map screen map display mode of start-up of). However, if you specify the period of time spent with the unit as an argument "h" (time) or "d" (day), to display the epicenter of just past the period. Also, if you specify the read time interval as the arguments that were put unit "m" (minutes) and read the hypocenter database for each that time interval. Waveform data files can not be specified. In the following example, the win of the map display mode to display and update the seismic source data for the past three days in every 10 minutes, and then run in the background of the shell.

        win -m 3d 10m &

[7]
    In the (-n) automatic gage mode, usually, the result will be saved automatically as the gage information file, if you specify this option, the results will not be saved. Because nothing remaining after all seems pointless, unless the background mode ( "-b"), will be able to see the progress on the screen.
[8]
    When drawing the monitor waveform of (-o) waveform screen, remove the DC offset of each channel, it is displayed as waveform swings around the middle. This option when you use the can, even if there is a bitmap file of the monitor waveform to a directory on the waveform data files, it is not used. (Description of rh [13])
[9]
    (-p) You specified when you use other than win.prm of the current directory as a parameter file, it gives the parameter file name as an argument.
[10]
    (-q) In the map data conversion mode ( "-c") and the epicenter calculation mode ( "-x") is not a normal win, after starting (automatic processing after the end if it is started if in the automatic processing mode) conversation mode It entered the wait for the input from the mouse, but if you set this option, at the same time win enters the conversation mode is terminated.
[11]
    After detecting a trigger in each observation point in the (-r) automatic gage, but you can make hypocenter determination by reading the P and S, if you specify this option, in the first stage of detecting the trigger, each observation It carried out a rough epicenter determine the trigger time of the point as a P-time, and save it to gage information file the results as preliminary. It also stores and then to continue the automatic gage final result. This is useful when the waveform file is large and time until the final result comes out is applied.

    The (-t) first waveform data file to copy as a temporary file in the working directory, and thereafter read the future waveform data. In particular, in order to frequently access the waveform data in such as automatic gage, when the waveform files are remote mounted, you may be able to significantly speed up the process in this option.

    (-w) Usually, monitor the waveform of the waveform screen, on a scale that has been set in the channel table file, all the channels will be expanded (drawing) to the bit map at startup. However, if there is a file name plus ".sv" in the waveform file name in the same directory as the waveform data file, it is considered to be the file where you saved the bitmap of the monitor waveform, will be loaded. Since this is not the bit map development of the monitor waveform in the case, start-up is much faster. Option "-w" tells to make (in the same directory as the waveform file) This bit map file.

    (-x) And epicenter determined from reading the data of the gage information file, and save the results to the same gage information file. This may be used when it is re-determined the epicenter to change the observation point parameters and velocity structure. Gage information file name to be specified as the first argument, it must be in the directory of the gage information file that has been set in the win.prm. Waveform data file name can not be specified as a boot argument, but can be obtained from the gage information file, waveform file itself is not required.
