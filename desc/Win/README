hard to Google search for a data format named "win32". Issues with the format
description are below.

LOW-LEVEL DESCRIPTION OMISSIONS AND ERRORS
All integers in the file header are unsigned except as noted.

FIELD   FIELD NAME      ERROR/OMISSION
10      Sampling size   (1) OMITTED: This is a 4-bit code.
                        (2) OMITTED: All data types represented by these codes
                            are two's-complement signed integers.
                        (3) ERROR: The codes given in the PDF are incorrect.
                            The correct code-data correspondence is:
                            0 = 4-bit integer
                            1 = 8-bit integer
                            2 = 16-bit integer
                            3 = 32-bit integer packed to 24 bits
                            4 = 32-bit integer
11      Number of       OMITTED: if sampling size code = 0, then this value
        samples         must be incremented by one to account for the half-byte
                        padding described in PDF note 2)
