README
* UW_data_format.pdf was found in a tarball for the UW file interface, assembled
by Prof. Steve Malone (steve@ess.washington.edu) on request from Dr. Joshua
Jones (jpjones.gphys@gmail.com), created 2016-03-03.

* uwdfif.pdf is the Unix manual page (manpage) for uwdfif, converted from

Addendum
I'm unable to ask questions about this data format: neither Steve Malone nor
Bob Crosson responds to my emails anymore. I'll provide the source tarball sent
to me 2016-03-03 by Steve Malone upon request.
