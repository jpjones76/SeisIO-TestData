NOTES
* It is unclear whether bad data can exist in a file that stores data as
Int16, the "invalid data point" is stored as an Int32 and the default value
is larger than an Int16 can represent. If it is NOT possible for Int16 data
to contain "invalid data point" values, then the code could be simplified a
great deal.
