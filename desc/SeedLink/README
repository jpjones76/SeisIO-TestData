ERRATA
* Commands should be followed by '\r', not '\n'. This information appears
nowhere in the documentation.
* Mode FETCH is very poorly documented. Missing information:
  + differences between FETCH and DATA
  + does FETCH work starting at a later time?
  + does FETCH work for past data? If so, do the buffers extend as far back as
  for DATA? They certainly didn't appear to in my tests!
* SeedLink appears to assign a bogus location code to streams from a channel
with no location code. Thus, the FDSN and SeedLink identifiers of a data
channel may differ.
