SEED Manual Errors and Inconsistencies

APPENDIX B
* This is grossly incomplete. Most decoders are not described and the
description of Steim is totally incoherent.

APPENDIX C
* The Z-transform representation in equation (3) is the usual Z-transform
of mathematicians, but many geophysics texts take the Z-transform as a power
series in Z rather than Z^-1. A famous example is E. R. Kanasewich (1981),
Time Sequence Analysis in Geophysics, which is the standard data analysis text
of most Geophysics graduate programs worldwide.

* The instructions for scaling on page 161 are about as clear as mud:
Scale the coefficients b n so that | Hc (zs) | = 1.0 where z s = e2 π i fs Δt ,
f s is specified in Blockette [58]. It is unclear whether coefficients
must be unscaled after being read in.

APPENDIX G
* Mini-SEED records acquired from seismic data centers are still <= 4096 Bytes
long because they are extracted without modification from full SEED archives.
